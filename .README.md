# SEACRIFOG
This is a tool for exploring the inventory of carbon-related observation infrastructure. There are numerous metadata repositories describing, and linking to, datasets related to carbon measurement in some way or another. These datasets are rich, but not easily discovered by existing search tools such as Google Search. 

The prototype (currently available at https://seacrifog.saeon.ac.za) is aimed at providing an interactive overview of the infrastructure that supports carbon measurements. Users can select/deselect various elements of the carbon observation infrastructure, which serves the dual purpose of providing detailed information on individual, selected components of the system, and also constraining search criteria that can be applied against various organizations’ metadata repositories across the world (providing these organizations make their repositories electronically searchable, which many do).

The prototype consists of a pair of software applications:

- A long running HTTP server that provides a publicly available API for interacting with the data representing the carbon observation platform model, and that acts as an adapter for specifying metadata-searches constrained by some selection of the platform entities
- A browser client (website) that provides a richly interactive UI for interacting with the API. 

The browser client is tightly coupled with the API logic. The API, however, can stand as a useful publicly available service in it’s own right.

# Data model
![alt text](images/data-model.png "Simplified ERD diagram showing the entities used in the search logic")

# API
The API provides HTTP endpoints, and a GraphQL interface. For the most part the HTTP endpoints are just stubs - they don't provide any real value at this point but as a proof of concept that a GraphQL and RESTful API can share the data access layer completely (so it's fairly straightforward to provide both).

<!-- - [API documentation](http://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za "API Documentation") -->
- [Interactive API Explorer](https://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/graphiql "GraphiQL")
- [GraphQL endpoint](http://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/graphql "API Endpoint")
- [HTTP endpoint](http://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/http) - [/http/variables](http://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/http/variables) & [/http/variables/:id](http://api.seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/http/variables/1)

#### [Integrations](api/src/resolvers/queries/search-metadata/)
Integrations need to be specified by a user in two places. These are:

1. Logic for polling network/site information from an endpoint - this is currently in the form of a JavaScript function that is executed on a scheduled interval. An example of the integration with ICOS is [included in the source code](api/src/cron/_icos-integration.js). Currently the source code of the API needs to be adjusted to include further integrations - but this is a straightforward change to make in the future.
2. Search logic needs to be specified per organization as a JavaScript function - [executors](api/src/resolvers/queries/search-metadata/executors). An example of the function contract is included in the source code. These functions are executed as child processes to the main Node.js process. Currently only JavaScript executors are supported, but it would be fairly straightforward to allow for interoperability between the API and executors in a variety of programming languages. To add a new executor, add an appropriate function to the source code and then redeploy the application.

#### [Data access layer](api/src/db/)
Data access is directly via SQL using the [Node Postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) PostgreSQL client, with a [thin wrapper](api/src/db/_query.js) over the query functionality to handle connection pooling (hopefully) correctly. GraphQL APIs require request level batching optimization even from the very beginning - due to the logic of how GraphQL queries are resolved - this is implemented as is typically done via the [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) library. All future work on the data access layer needs to implement database queries via this pattern - there are many references WRT to how to use DataLoader in the context of this project.

# Client
The client currently deployed at [seacrifog.saeon.ac.za](http://seacrifog.saeon.ac.za/graphql "SEACRIFOG Work package 5.4 deliverable deployment on SAEON's infrastructure") as an SPA (Single Page Application), such is typical of React.js client apps. Architecturally, the client is organized conceptually of 'pages', each page comprising one or more 'modules'. Observational infrastructure is organized according to entity 'class'. For each entity class there is a page that lists all entities of that type (a list/explorer page), and an overview page that allows for seeing and editing a single entity. For example, all the entities of type `Variable` can be found on the HTTP path `/variables`, listed and searchable in a table. A single variable can be viewed and edited on the `/variable/:id` path. There is an exception - the `/sites` route displays a map of sites, along with proof-of-concept visualization charts. Individual sites can be edited on the `/networks/:id` path (sites of a particular network can be edited). Below is a representation of the site map:

```
.
├── /sites
├── /networks
│   └── /networks/:id
├── /variables
│   └── /variables/:id
├── /protocols
│   └── /protocols/:id
└── /search-results
```

## Modules
The concept of **modules** WRT the client refers to reusable react components. There is no definite difference between a **component** and a **module** in the context of SEACRIFOG. Essentially at some point a component is considered large enough to be a module, or sometimes modules export a number of related components. These are defined in [client/src/modules](client/src/modules).

#### [Atlas](client/src/modules/atlas)
The map is provided by OpenLayers 6, utilizing an API provided by a thin React.js wrapper library - [@saeon/ol-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saeon/ol-react "React OL Wrapper library") - authored by SAEON (at the time of writing there are no well-maintained OpenLayers 6 React.js wrapping libraries) and made available as MIT-licensed open source code. OpenLayers in the context of a JavaScript application is just a single object `olMap`. This object keeps it's own internal state and handles interactions internally. The `@saeon/ol-react` wrapper layer essentially provides the means of mapping React state to `olMap` internal state. This is achieved via using the [ECMAScript Proxy objects API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Note that this is incompatible with Internet Explorer, and not possible to polyfill. This tool as it currently exists should, however, work on Internet Explorer 11 and upwards only because no advanced layer management is used. This will obviously not be the case with further development. In addition to the layer proxy, the Atlas module provides a means of selecting/deselecting map features, and also for specifying layers.

Throughout the client the `@saeon/ol-react` component is used directly. The `Atlas` module consists of map-related exports that are reused wherever maps are shown (these maps use the same layers, styles, configurable sources, etc.).

#### [DataMutation](client/src/modules/data-mutation/index.js)
A simple component that wraps Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook.

#### [DataQuery](client/src/modules/data-query/index.js)
A simple component that wraps Apollo Client's `useQuery` hook.

#### [EditorPage](client/src/modules/editor-page/)
A collection of components that are the basis of the 'editor' pages (`/networks/:id`, `/variables/:id`, and `/protocols/:id`). The components include headers, input field formatters, etc.

Typically web forms are binded to some model - often referred to as 'form model binding'. This conceptually allows for representation of some table/object state as an appropriate input field. Similarly, this concept is utilized in SEACRIFOG. All the edit pages make use of UI logic to draw editable forms from JavaScript object (and provide a means of saving them to the database via GraphQL mutations).

#### [ExplorerPage](client/src/modules/explorer-page/)
A collection of components that are the basis of the list/explorer pages (`/networks`, `/variables`, and `/protocols`). The components include headers, buttons, user-feedback messages, etc.

#### [Layout](client/src/modules/layout/)
A collection of components that are used to draw the SPA. These include a `<Footer />` component that is used on most pages as well as navigation-related components that are typically only used once as 'parents' to other components used throughout the application. HTML path-based routing is handled by the `react-router` library.

#### [Global state management & Search module](client/src/modules/shared-components/_global-state.jsx)
State is managed in three ways across the application:

- Locally: state that is localized to individual components is achieved via stateful component ([class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)) or by using the newer [React Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- Explicitly: Stateful contexts are typically provided across groups of components via well-known React architectural patterns including [explicitly passing props down component trees](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html), or the [render props pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
- Globally via the [context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

A single global state module is used to keep track of user interactions across the app (selecting/deselecting of items). As entities are toggled a background search is performed for all currently selected search criteria - the results are stored in client memory.

#### [SharedComponents](client/src/modules/shared-components/)
For the most part, components are used directly as provided by the React-MD library - already a significant amount of work in terms of crafting reusable components! However there are a few cases in this UI that 'grouped element trees' are reused in multiple places throughout the application. These include:

- User-feedback messages (kept in a single place for consistency)
- A controlled table that supports searching, sorting, and selecting rows (controlled meaning that state is handled by a parent component, so that selecting rows can update the global state)
- A filterable list of items that can be selected/deselected - also controlled
- The Side filter component used throughout the application. This component combines many instances of the `DropdownSelect` componet, along with controlling callbacks to update the global state module. This component is used on most pages - it provides direct access to the the current global state in terms of what is being filtered
- ChartStateManagement - Interactive charts are shown as a proof of concept. The API currently  requires that management of state is done via context
- A form component - simple to place anywhere in the component tree, and provides localized state management for all elements in the sub tree.

## Pages
The concept of **pages** WRT the client refers to what is displayed at any particular URI. Pages comprise **modules**. These are defined in [client/src/pages](client/src/pages).

#### [/home](client/src/pages/home/) [/](client/src/pages/home/)
Static information mostly - partner logos are shown on this page.

#### [/sites](client/src/pages/explorer-sites/)
The map is interactive in that it allows for assessing which variables are measured at which sites (or groups of sites) - this is achieved by clicking features on the atlas, that will both add selected sites to the metadata filter, and trigger charts (provided by `eCharts`) to display.

#### [/networks](client/src/pages/explorer-networks/) [/variables](client/src/pages/explorer-variables/) [/protocols](client/src/pages/explorer-protocols/)
These routes display the list/explorer pages. Mostly the pages make use of the reusable components that comprise the **ExplorerPage** module.

#### [/networks/:id](client/src/pages/editor-networks/) [/variables/:id](client/src/pages/editor-variables/) [/protocols/:id](client/src/pages/editor-protocols/)
These routes display editor pages for the various entities, utilizing reusable components that form the **EditorPage** module.

#### [/search-results](client/src/pages/search-results/)
The search results page comprises a tabbed layout with the content of the tab a list of search results. This is easy to see via a visual representation of the element tree that is rendered on this page:

```
.
├── Toolbar header
└── Tab container
    ├── Tab content (org 1)
    │   └── Virtualized list (handles many records)
    │       ├── RecordViewer
    │       │   └── OrgRenderer
    │       ├── RecordViewer
    │       │   └── OrgRenderer
    │       └── (many more records) ...
    ├── Tab content (org 2)
    │   └── Virtualized list
    │       ├── RecordViewer
    │       │   └── OrgRenderer
    │       ├── RecordViewer
    │       │   └── OrgRenderer
    │       └── (many more records) ...
    └── ...
```

The **OrgRenderer** object is passed as properties to the **RecordViewer** component. A list of OrgRenderer objects is provided as [configuration](client/src/pages/search-results/configuration.js) to the item renderer (`<RecordViewer org={OrgRenderedObj} />`). Loosely speaking this pattern is referred to as **dependency injection**.

Renderer objects comprise a variety of callbacks that are passed individual records. These callbacks need to be user-defined to return the correct information per field. The configuration file shows all the organizations that have been integrated into SEACRIFOG. Further work on SEACRIFOG could involve providing a means of editing the configuration object from a web UI - this would allow organizations to 'register' how their metadata records should be displayed. (Note that a similar registration process would need to be implemented on the API so that users could also define how any organization could be searched).
