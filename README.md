# SEACRIFOG Client
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dev environment setup
Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
Start the dev server: `npm start`

## Testing
Run `npm test`. This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Production build
Run `npm run build`. This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
