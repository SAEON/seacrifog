## Dev environment setup
Install the project dependencies: `npm install`<br>
Start the dev server: `npm start`

### Notes
1. Testing this on Windows (using `npm` via Powershell), I had to install `npm-run-all` globally. `npm install npm-run-all -g`
2. Running `npm install`, some of the packages will install platform specific bindings. So if something isn't working try removing the `node_modules` directory and re-running `npm install`
